  <h2>What?</h2>
  <p>We are going to create a dynamic, visual display of purchase data which sits on top of WRLD3D’s Overgate map.<br> 
  <br>A 3D "bar" will be displayed for each shop. The bar's colour represents the hourly conversion rate for the shop in question:
  <br><br> <ul>Target Met = <font color="green">Green</font>
  <br> Near Target = <font color="orange">Amber</font>
  <br> Target Not Met = <font color="red">Red</font></ul>
    
  <br>The height of the bar determines the number of customers who entered the shop during the selected time period (the taller the bar the more people).
  <br><br>Each shop will be categorised into three types:
  <br><br><ul>Retail (40% expected conversion rate)
  <br>Food & Drink (**** expected conversion rate)
  <br>Services (**** expected conversion rate)</ul>
  </p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="container">
  <h2>Why?</h2>
  <blockquote>
  <p>“Should Overgate charge a higher fixed rate rent or charge a lower rent along with a certain % of a business’ revenue? Which is more lucrative?"</p>
  <footer>The question we hope to answer</footer>
  </blockquote>
   
  <br><br> The reason we are making this solution is to allow Overgate to maximize their potential profits by ensuring their space is as busy and lucrative as possible.
